# Multi-Omics Analysis Made Easy: A Breast Cancer Example

This document provides an overview of multi-omics analysis techniques using breast cancer as a case study.

## Introduction

Multi-omics analysis integrates data from various molecular levels—such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—to provide a comprehensive view of biological systems. Breast cancer serves as an important example due to its complexity and the wealth of omics data available.

## Methods

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Retrieve genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic datasets from public repositories (e.g., TCGA, GEO).
   - Perform quality control and preprocessing steps.

2. **Analysis and Visualization**  
   - Conduct dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).
   - Perform pathway enrichment and survival analysis.

3.
